# 📈 RSI Scrapper

---

RSI Scrapper is a simple tool I developped in Python for a friend. I've decided to make it public since it might be slightly helpful to some traders or even curious programmers like me.

## 📝 Purpose

RSI Scrapper is a tool allowing traders to fetch breakpoints from a specific timeline and cryptocurrency. It scraps data from a CSV file provided by the user, analyzes its RSI values and prints out all the recorded breakpoints.

It can also be configured to send the results to a Discord server using webhooks.

## ⚙️ Tutorial 

> You will need Python 3 for the script to work. 

- Download the latest release
- Upload your CSV file from TradingView in the root folder
- Execute main.py
- Specify webhook or leave blank
- Enjoy!
